## Steps to make this repository
1- First we created a new repository on github  
2- Then we cloned it to our local machine  
3- Then we created requirements.txt file and put the required libraries in it  
4- Then we created .gitignore file and put the files that we don't want to push to github in it. For choosing the files we used [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)  
5- Then we created the main file and put the first api in it  
6- For having better package structure we created a folder named src for the api and put the moved the main file to it.  
7- The next step was to create branches for adding ci/cd and dockerfile to the project and then merge them to the main branch.  
8- There is a mistake in ci/cd related branch commit message. The mistake is that we use "and" word in commit message and actually changed two different things in the commit. This mistake raised by project leader and won't happen again.  
9- Another part was fixing the merge conflicts. In [this](https://github.com/mhbahmani/SE_LAB_1/commit/477fe1526f391a4565a5a6ca781119ad5e8382f0) commit we was merging one branch to the master branch and there was a conflict in the main file. We fixed it by choosing the correct lines from the two branches.  
10- Also we had some pull requests in this projects that two of them are accessible in [this](https://github.com/mhbahmani/SE_LAB_1/pull/1) and [this](https://github.com/mhbahmani/SE_LAB_1/pull/2) links.
11- In order to having a better git flow, we set master branch as a protected branch and set the rules for merging to it.
